                Johannesburg, located in the southern country of Africa, is the capital city of the land.
                It is the largest city in the country and is a major economic powerhouse.
                Johannesburg is also known as the City Of Gold due to its origins in the gold mining industry.
                It also has my favourite amusement park named after its previous stance as a lovely gold mining site —
                Gold Reef City.

                Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Britney, and I’m currently a student at BYU Pathway Worldwide.
                I have a deep passion for learning and self-improvement, especially when it comes to technology and
                personal growth.
                I enjoy taking peaceful walks that allow me to reflect and recharge, and I absolutely love building
                code.
                Programming has become more than just a skill—it's a passion I work on daily, constantly expanding my
                knowledge and
                pushing myself to learn new concepts and tools. Whether it's debugging a tricky function or exploring a
                new language,
                I'm always eager to dive deeper into the world of tech.
                I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to all the opportunities the future has in store.
                Thank you for stopping by and getting to know a little about me!
            </p>
